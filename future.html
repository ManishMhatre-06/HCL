      <h2>The Future of Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        We are building a new way of programming—one that removes unnecessary
        barriers between human intent and machine execution. Today, our system
        already allows users to write instructions in natural language, which are
        interpreted through predefined semantic rules and executed via carefully
        constructed Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). While this approach is currently
        rule-based, it is only the foundation of a much larger vision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our long-term goal is to fundamentally change how people write code.
      </p>

      <h2>Toward Rule-Free Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional programming languages require developers to memorize strict
        syntax rules, formatting conventions, and language-specific constructs.
        This creates a steep learning curve and slows down creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our future direction is <strong>rule-free coding</strong>, where users
        focus entirely on <em>what they want to achieve</em>, not <em>how the
        language demands it be written</em>. Instead of enforcing rigid syntax
        like Python, C++, or Java, our system will progressively learn to
        interpret intent directly from natural language—freeing users from
        syntactic constraints altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        Programming should feel like problem-solving, not syntax management.
      </p>

      <h2>A New Breakthrough in Coding with AI</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to create a breakthrough where AI is not just a helper, but a
        <strong>core execution partner</strong> in the coding process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than simply translating prompts into code, the system will:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understand intent at a semantic level</li>
        <li>Infer missing details intelligently</li>
        <li>Resolve ambiguity through contextual reasoning</li>
        <li>Choose optimal execution paths automatically</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This represents a shift from <em>language-centric programming</em> to
        <em>intent-centric programming</em>, powered by AI.
      </p>

      <h2>A More Versatile and Seamless Coding Experience</h2>
      <p>
        User experience is central to our future roadmap. Writing code should
        feel fluid, intuitive, and interruption-free.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Smooth multi-step instructions written naturally</li>
        <li>Seamless nesting of logic without rigid structure</li>
        <li>Adaptive understanding of user style and phrasing</li>
        <li>Minimal friction between thought and execution</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The system should adapt to the user—not the other way around.
      </p>

      <h2>No Need to Learn Strict Syntax Rules</h2>
      <p>
        One of our most important commitments is accessibility.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Beginners can build logic without learning syntax first</li>
        <li>Experienced developers move faster without boilerplate</li>
        <li>Non-technical users can express logic naturally</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By eliminating strict syntax requirements, we make programming more
        inclusive, expressive, and human-friendly.
      </p>

      <h2>Integrated AI Coding Assistant</h2>
      <p>
        We plan to integrate a <strong>dedicated AI chatbot</strong> directly into
        the platform to guide users throughout their coding journey.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Explain what the system understood from input</li>
        <li>Suggest improvements or optimizations</li>
        <li>Ask clarifying questions when intent is ambiguous</li>
        <li>Teach concepts progressively</li>
        <li>Help users evolve naturally</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is not just execution—but understanding and growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Advanced Error Handling and Auto-Correction</h2>
      <p>
        Errors are inevitable, but frustration should not be.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Semantic-level error detection</li>
        <li>Human-readable explanations</li>
        <li>Natural-language corrections</li>
        <li>Automatic fixes when possible</li>
        <li>Learning from recurring mistakes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding feels natural and expressive</li>
        <li>AI bridges thought and execution</li>
        <li>Learning barriers are removed</li>
        <li>Creativity comes before syntax</li>
        <li>Programming becomes a universal skill</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This project is not just about writing code differently.<br />
        <strong>It is about redefining what coding is.</strong>
